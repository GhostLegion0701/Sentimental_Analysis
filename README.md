Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone of a given text. It helps classify text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral, allowing businesses and researchers to analyze opinions, feedback, and emotions expressed in written content. This technique is widely used in applications like social media monitoring, customer reviews, and brand sentiment tracking.

The process of Sentiment Analysis involves various NLP methods, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Machine learning models or rule-based approaches analyze textual data to understand sentiment patterns. Advanced deep learning techniques, such as transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), further enhance the accuracy of sentiment predictions.

This project aims to build an efficient Sentiment Analysis model that can process and classify text data accurately. By leveraging NLP techniques, the model will help extract valuable insights from textual content, making it useful for applications in market analysis, user feedback interpretation, and automated sentiment tracking.
